Some stuff I developed during my PhD Thesis :
- Python scripts for simulations and transform the results into viewable files
- q space reconstruction for x-ray scattering experiments
- q space mapping during x-ray scattering experiments, with all the imaginable angles of a diffractometer.

Not maintained at all.
